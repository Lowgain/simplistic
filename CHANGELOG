1.0.10 (2011-01-25)
 * Fixed: Multiple attribute retrieval: Item.attributes(Set[String]) was
          incorrectly returning all attributes, not just those requested.
 * Fixed: Item.attribute(attributeName) would throw a NoSuchElementException
          if the item didn't have any value.  It now correctly returns an empty
          Set.

1.0.9 (2011-01-13)
 * Fixed: Attribute removal: Item.-=() was incorrectly passing attributeName in
          place of itemName.
 * Added: Item.attribute() and -=() now accept an Attribute as well as String.

1.0.8 (2011-01-12)
 * Added: Automatic retry with exponential backoff if SimpleDB returns
          ServiceUnavailable error

1.0.7 (2011-01-11)
 * Fixed: Prevent NPE if null-valued attributes are set.
          Null attributes are now ignored and equivalent to no attribute.

1.0.6 and before:
 * Added: Test suites using FakeSDB as backend.
 * Added: Single required/optional and multi-valued attributes (Larry Ogrodnek)
 * Added: Conditional put support (Larry Ogrodnek)
 * Added: QueryableDomain.findFirst(Expression)
 * Removed: Query API (was experimental; now use Select API exclusively)
 * Changed: Use camelCase method names (e.g. order_by => orderBy)
 * Changed: domain.apply(expression) replaced by domain.select(expression)
 * Added: domain.first(expression) that uses "limit 1" under the hood
 * Added: conditional put variant domain.setIf(condition)(attributes)
 * Added: Item.delete() as alias to clear()

1.0.0 (2010-11-24)
 * Forked, cleaned up and ported to Scala 2.8.0.
